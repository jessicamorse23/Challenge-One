# Challenge-One

## Description

The website code was refactored to meet current standards for accessibility. 
By modifying the code to include semantic elements, users will be able to access the 
website with technologies such as screen readers. Removing extra elements of code in the
CSS stylesheet will help the page load faster in browsers. In this challenge, I learned
about semantic elements for HTML and CSS. I also learned how to look for extraneous 
code and the DRY method of coding.
